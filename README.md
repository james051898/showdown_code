Current state of the project:
  **pokemon_analysis.py** aggregates data from the text files in a fairly neat dataframe. Data in each cell is not clean yet.
  
  **object_orientated.py** pokemon object
  
   get_ability: method returns abilities in a dictionary {key(name of ability) : value(probability)} 
  
   get_type: method returns type1 and type2 of pokemon(needs better support for single vs dual typing)
  
   get_bst: method returns a pokemons base stats
  
   get_spread: does nothing lol
                           
  **pokeshowdown.py** currently the main driver of the program but also gets opponents team from chat log folders
  
To Do: 
1. Learn about how to create a pokemon class
2. Add methods to get probabilities
3. Learn about coding styles and how to more efficiently manage variables(refactoring)
